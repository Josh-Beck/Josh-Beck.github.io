    <p>
      My time at Iowa State has been filled with many oppportunities for personal
      development and achievement. I was involved in the Iowa State Marching Band
      for 3 years, enjoying many home and away games with the Cyclones, and taking
      the position of guide in my third year. As part of this position, I worked with
      one other member of the band to lead a rank of 9 people, instructing them on
      proper marching technique and helping communicate the directions of band leadership.
      <br><br>
      My time in marching band also extended into basketball season, where I
      played with the mens basketball pep band for 3 years. This fantastic group was
      smaller and had a focus on higher quality sound unlike the visual focus found
      in marching band. This group was a highlight of my time in college, allowing
      me the oppportunity to travel to two Big-12 Basketball tournaments, the NCAA
      tournament, and watch the Iowa State Cyclones win the Big-12 Championship.

    <h2>Rubik's Cube Competition Organizer</h2>

    <p>
      Since high school I have been actively involved in Rubik's Cube competitions.
      These events revolve around "cubers" coming together to solve Rubik's cubes
      of different shapes and sizes as quickly as they can. This great hobby has
      afforded me some wonderful oppportunities, such as making friends with people
      across the country and world, and traveling to multiple national tournaments to
      compete with the best of the best. Additionally, I have achieved many personal
      goals, such as solving a Rubik's cube in 7 seconds, obtaining multiple Iowa records,
      and ranking in the top 400 of speedcubers worldwide.
      <br><br>
      Beyond the competing, in recent years I have hosted my own competitions,
      to allow cubers from around the state and midwest to come enjoy this fantastic
      hobby. These competitions range from about 80 to 150 competitors, with total
      attendance exceeding 300 people. For my part as organizer, I was responsible
      for finding a venue, scheduling events, organizing a volunteer staff,
      and maintaining a budget to ensure a well run event.
