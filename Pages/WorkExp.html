      Since October I have worked part time for John Deere in Ames, developing and testing embedded systems.
      I have lead the effort to test lighting components, assisted in developing features for a control system,
      and have most recently been working to optimze the testing system, with hopes of reducing the time engineer's
      spend between tests by about 75%. This work has been primarily individual, with collaboration from a full time
      colleague. The majority of my work has been done using C or Batch Scripting, with Windows Powershell used to
      assist my work.

      During the summer of 2019, I worked for John Deere's Power Systems branch, on a team tasked with determining
       the cause of engine failure. Over the course of the summer
       I worked on a plethora of projects, including data analysis and vizualization of engine data using Matlab,
      engine component design using Creo Parametric, and altering manufacturing processes through
      communication with internal and external colleagues.
