      Since October, 2019 I have worked part time for John Deere, developing and testing embedded systems.
      I have led the effort to test lighting components and assisted in developing features for a control system.
      Most recently I have been working to optimize the testing system with hopes of reducing the time engineers
      spend between tests by about 75%. This work has been primarily individual, with collaboration from a full time
      colleague. The majority of my work has been done using C or Batch Scripting, along with Windows Powershell. <br>

      During the summer of 2019 I worked for John Deere's Power Systems branch, on a team tasked with determining
       the cause of engine failure and developing continuous improvement solutions.
       I worked on a plethora of projects, including data analysis and vizualization of engine data using Matlab,
      engine component design using Creo Parametric, and altering manufacturing processes through
      communication with internal and external colleagues.<br>

    <p style="padding-top:0%; margin-top:1%;">
      Summer 2018 I worked for Principal Financial on a scrum team using the agile
      development method to develop and configure their business-to-business
      Salesforce platform. The team was responsible for developing a chat feature,
      which was embedded in the business facing website via a REST API. The chat
      function required the implementation of token based security, tracking
      and diagnostics to assist sales representatives, and data aggregation
      of chat times and success ratings. The team
      also spent time improving existing data vizualization through database
      querying and Salesforce configuration.<br>
