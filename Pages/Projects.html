      <h2 style="padding-top:5%; padding-bottom:0%; margin-bottom:0%;">Twitter API Project</h2>

      <p style="padding-bottom: 0%; padding-top:0%; margin-top:1%;">
        The Twitter API project was an individual project split into 2 parts,
        with the goal of better understanding API interaction and web requests.
        The first was the Twitter Bot Guessing Game. This part of the project
        used the Twitter API, Python libraries, and basic game
        development structure to develop a simple guessing game where a query is sent
        to Twitter to obtain popular tweets, those tweets are displayed, and the
        user inputs which tweet they believe has the most likes.<br>
        The second portion of the project involved interacting with the
        Twitter API on a more in depth level, using specific functionality of the
        Twitter API to control many elements of the Twitter account. This functionality
        included: posting tweets to main timeline, getting tweets from specific users and
        the bot's own timeline, direct messaging users, and querying general data based on inputs.

      <h4 style="padding-bottom: 0%; margin-bottom:1%;">Project description: </h4>
      <p style="padding-bottom: 0%; padding-top:0%; margin-top:1%;">
        This was a team project completed at a hackathon during my internship at Principal
        Financial. The goal was to automate the scanning process
        of real estate memorandums to collect information, saving human effort.
         The final product consisted of a dynamic map which
        interfaced with our database built to store the scanned information collected
        by the Natural Language Processing system.

      <p style="padding-top:0%; margin-top:1%;">
        I worked on the back-end of the project, using a mix of Python, AWS Lambda,
        and Amazon Comprehend to develop a scanning function. This function worked by
        accessing a document from an S3 Bucket, scanning the document using AWS Lambda and Python,
        then running commands through Amazon Comprehend to
        retrieve relevant information in the form of a JSON file.
        The retrieved information was returned to be parsed for database entry.

      <h4 style="padding-bottom: 0%; margin-bottom:1%;">Project description: </h4>
      <p style="padding-bottom: 0%; padding-top:0%; margin-top:1%;">
        This individual project revolved around a desire to test algorithms more
        efficiently than by hand on a physical Rubik's cube. The main goal was to
        build a completely functional, virtual Rubik's cube, with additional goals
        to run complex algorithms and receive informative outputs. Additions to
        the project included a program which predicted the number of cycles
        an algorithm would run, and an algorithm generator.

      <h2 style="padding-bottom: 0%; padding-top: 7%; margin-bottom:1%;"> Priority Queue Based Web Crawler</h2>
      <h4 style="padding-bottom: 0%; margin-bottom:1%;">Project description: </h4>
      <p style="padding-bottom: 0%; padding-top:0%; margin-top:1%;">
        The objective for this team assignment was to develop a web crawler with a priority queue,
        with the purpose of finding the most relevant links on a given Wikipedia page.
        The crawler would parse through a given number of pages and return links, which
        would be given a priority value. From there, the links were sorted in a priority
        queue and output in a particular order such that links deemed most relevant
        would appear first. The result was an algorithm that could accurately
       crawl through a webpage, locate relevant Wikipedia links, and return them
       to the user by priority.

      <h4 style="padding-top:0%; padding-bottom: 0%; margin-bottom:1%;">My role: </h4>
      <p style="padding-top:0%; margin-top:1%;">
        I developed the priority queue and "tuple" objects, which were used
        as generic containers for each link. Links were given
        a priority value based on certain features, and the priority queue used
        time efficient algorithms to place and reorder the queue based on priority.
