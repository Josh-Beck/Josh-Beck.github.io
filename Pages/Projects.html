      <h2>Rubik's Cube Simulator</h2>

      <p>
        The Rubik's Cube project was one of the highlights of my sophomore year.
          The purpose was to create a virtual representation of the cube, in order to
          run specific algorithmic tests on it, checking for move cycle counts.
          This project was completed in Java, and featured object oriented programming,
          basic control loops for inputs, an output display and diagnostics.

      <h2>Natural Language Processing</h2>

      <p>
        This was a team project completed at a hackathon during my time at Principal
        Financial. The goal of the project was to automate the scanning process
        of real estate memorandums to collect information, saving human effort.
        I worked on the back-end of the project, using a mix of Python, AWS Lambda,
        and Amazon Comprehend to develop the scanning function. The final product
        consisted of a dynamic map developed by other members of the team, which
        interfaced with our database built to store the scanned information collected
        by the Natural Language Processing system.

      <p>
        I was tasked, along with a partner, to develop a web crawler with a priority queue,
         with the purpose of finding the most relevant links on a given Wikipedia page.
         I developed the priority queue and "tuple" objects, which were to be used
         as
