      <p style="padding-bottom: 0%; padding-top:0%; margin-top:1%;">
        This was a team project completed at a hackathon during my internship at Principal
        Financial. The goal was to automate the scanning process
        of real estate memorandums to collect information, saving human effort.
         The final product consisted of a dynamic map which
        interfaced with our database built to store the scanned information collected
        by the Natural Language Processing system.

        I worked on the back-end of the project, using a mix of Python, AWS Lambda,
        and Amazon Comprehend to develop a scanning function. This function worked by
        accessing a document from an S3 Bucket, scanning the document using AWS Lambda and Python,
        then running commands through Amazon Comprehend to
        retrieve relevant information in the form of a JSON file.
        The retrieved information was returned to be parsed for database entry.

        This individual project revolved around a desire to test algorithms more
        efficiently than by hand on a physical Rubik's cube. The main goal was to
        build a completely functional, virtual Rubik's cube, with additional goals
        to run complex algorithms and receive informative outputs. Additions to
        the project included a program which predicted the number of cycles
        an algorithm would run, and an algorithm generator.

      <h2 style="padding-bottom: 0%; padding-top: 7%; margin-bottom:1%;"> Priority Queue Based Web Crawler</h2>
      <h4 style="padding-bottom: 0%; margin-bottom:1%;">Project description: </h4>
      <p style="padding-bottom: 0%; padding-top:0%; margin-top:1%;">
        The objective for this team assignment was to develop a web crawler with a priority queue,
        with the purpose of finding the most relevant links on a given Wikipedia page.
        The crawler would parse through a given number of pages and return links, which
        would be given a priority value. From there, the links were sorted in a priority
        queue and output in a particular order such that links deemed most relevant
        would appear first. The result was an algorithm that could accurately
       crawl through a webpage, locate relevant Wikipedia links, and return them
       to the user by priority.

      <h4 style="padding-top:0%; padding-bottom: 0%; margin-bottom:1%;">My role: </h4>
      <p style="padding-top:0%; margin-top:1%;">
        I developed the priority queue and "tuple" objects, which were used
        as generic containers for each link. Links were given
        a priority value based on certain features, and the priority queue used
        time efficient algorithms to place and reorder the queue based on priority.
