    <p>
      My name is Joshua Beck, a software engineer at Genesys, with a
      degree in Mechanical Engineering and a in Computer Science from
      Iowa State University. My work style is passionate and
      driven, emphasizing learning and professional development.
      I am outgoing, social, and consider leading by example as a member of a
      team to be one of my greatest strengths.
    <br>
    <br>
      My professional skillset is based on problem solving; software and
      mechanical engineering are two facets for my skillset to shine. I
      am a strong developer in languages such as Java and Matlab, and have the
      ability to learn any new program or platform. This coding proficiency
      is backed by experience in both classroom and business settings, working on
      b2b platforms, optimizing algorithms, and developing embedded controllers.
      In addition I have developed a strong background in mechanical design including
      CAD modeling in two major CAD programs, and participating in multiple large,
      team-based design projects through my classes.
    <br>
    <br>
      Outside of work I enjoy playing my trombone and speed solving Rubik's
      cubes, as well as practicing my cyber security on websites like
      HackTheBox.
    <br>
    <br>
      I am currently seeking a cyber/information security or software
      development role. For more information on my work experience and
      projects, contact me at joshuathomasbeck@gmail.com,
