    <p>
      My name is Joshua Beck, I am a senior at Iowa State University,
      pursuing a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering with a minor
      in Computer Science. I describe my work style as passionate and
      driven, with an emphasis on learning and professional development.
      I am outgoing, social, and consider leading by example as a member of a
      team, rather than the leader, to be one of my greatest strengths.

      My professional skillset is based in problem solving, with software and
      mechanical engineering being the two facets for that skillset to shine. I
      am a strong developer in languages such as Java and Matlab, and have the
      diversity to learn almost any new program you can throw at me
      (I learned html and css just for this website!). This coding proficiency
      is backed by learning in both classroom and business settings, where I
      have worked on b2b platforms, optimizing algorithms and embedded controllers.
      In addition to software, I have developed a strong background in Mechanical design including
      CAD modeling in two major CAD programs, and participating in multiple large,
      team-based design projects through my classes at Iowa State.
