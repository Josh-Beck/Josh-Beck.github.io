    <p>
      My name is Joshua Beck, a senior at Iowa State University
      pursuing a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering with a minor
      in Computer Science. My work style is passionate and
      driven, emphasizing learning and professional development.
      I am outgoing, social, and consider leading by example as a member of a
      team to be one of my greatest strengths.
    <br>
    <br>
      My professional skillset is based on problem solving; software and
      mechanical engineering are two facets for my skillset to shine. I
      am a strong developer in languages such as Java and Matlab, and have the
      ability to learn any new program or platform. This coding proficiency
      is backed by experience in both classroom and business settings, working on
      b2b platforms, optimizing algorithms, and developing embedded controllers.
      In addition I have developed a strong background in mechanical design including
      CAD modeling in two major CAD programs, and participating in multiple large,
      team-based design projects through my classes.
    <br>
    <br>
      Outside of class and work I participate in many activities, including
      playing trombone in multiple bands at Iowa State, solving Rubik's cubes competively,
      and leading a Christian small group.
      <br><br>
      I am currently seeking a software development role in Raleigh, North Carolina,
      where I will be relocating to after I graduate in May, 2020.
