### Genesys
Genesys Cloud's search team was responsible for our big data elastic search infrastructure, which served our suite of products with low latency, highly distributed search capabilities. My role as an associate software developer was to support the development of our search clusters and maintain the health of our AWS infrastructure through our on-call rotation.
