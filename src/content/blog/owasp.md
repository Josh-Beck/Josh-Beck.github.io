### OWASP GenAI Security Project
I support the OWASP GenAI Security Project through contributions to multiple agentic AI documents. This flagship offering from
OWASP provides security professionals across the world with vital resources to support the security of their AI applications. My contributions not only add to the incredible wealth of knowledge from the most accomplished security professionals in the AI space, those seasoned experts also give me a feedback loop to further develop my agentic AI security skills.

### My Contributions
My contributions will be found in OWASP GenAI Project releases over the next few months of 2025. Be on the look out!
