let codeSecurityData = `Secure code review is an incredibly important part of any security minded organization. 
It's more than PR code review. It's taking into account the entire realm of a website, 
examining how inputs & malicious attacks enter into the codebase, then tracing all interactions to their source. 
Using secure code review methodologies, I have reviewed many applications in about a dozen different languages, 
with excellent results, not only finding vulnerabilities, but also using the deep knowledge gained about a 
target application to better educate developers about how to secure their code.`;


let awsData = `AWS is the main cloud provider I have used throughout my career. I have received two certifications 
from AWS, the Security Specialty and Developer Associate certifications. Specifically, I have experience developing 
in EC2, Fargate and Lambda, and have experience securing entire enterprise AWS accounts, from entrance through API Gateway
until storage or release of data through systems like S3, Dyanmo and RDS.`

let pythonData = `I use Python for many enterprise and personal level use cases. I was instrumental in the set up of 
new Python Lambda functions for John Deere Financial's Security by Design portal, improving our development cycle time, 
lowering burden on our Java server, and simplifying our codebase.
Additionally, I use Python as my primary scripting
language for hacking and projects for which simple and quick code is necessary.`
