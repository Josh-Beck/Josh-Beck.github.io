            Howdy! My name is Josh. Before all else, I am a Christian, saved by faith in Jesus Christ.
            After that, I am a husband and security engineer. Particularly, I am passionate about application and API security, and 
            spend most of my time reviewing and supporting cloud native, digital applications. 
            <br />

            <h3> Certifications </h3>
            I have earned 4 certifications which display my passion for learning and
            pedigree of cyber skills. These were chosen to support my general security knowledge, cloud development 
            abilities and offensive testing skills.<br /><br />
            
            <ul>
                <li>CompTIA Security+</li>
                <li>AWS Developer Associate</li>
                <li>AWS Security Specialty</li>
                <li>Offensive Security Web Assessor (OSWA)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3> HackTheBox </h3>
            I have spent significant time honing my craft using resources like HackTheBox. In my initial
            days of learning cyber security, the site was incredibly useful to teach me the basics of hacking and provide me
            and offensive mindset for how to look at vulnerabilities and approach remediation.
            <br />
            <br />
            Since establishing myself in the cyber security space, I have made an effort to give back to the community and flex my 
            creative muscles. Specifically, I have created multiple development oriented HackTheBox challenges, in 
            order to encourage others in the community to develop the same secure code skills I have been working towards over the course
            of my career.
