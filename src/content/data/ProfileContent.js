            Howdy! My name is Josh. I am a Christian, husband, and Security Architect at SAS, where I lead security initiatives 
            within the Applied Artificial Intelligence & Modeling division. In this role, I am responsible for developing secure architectures, 
            conducting secure design reviews of our products, and ensuring compliance with company policies & standards. Our division spearheads 
            the company's development of cutting-edge agentic and generative AI systems. I am at the forefront
            of developing the innovative security controls that keep pace with our advanced engineering.

            <br />
            <br />
            My expertise is rooted in application security, with a strong background in cloud and API security gained from my time
            at John Deere. During my tenure there, I developed and implemented key security controls for cloud-based applications, 
            led security reviews of critical APIs, and reduced security vulnerabilities by 50%. 
            <br />
            <br />
            I am also an active supporter of the OWASP GenAI project, contributing to its agentic offerings by developing security 
            guidelines and best practices. I am passionate about sharing knowledge and frequently 
            present cybersecurity content at conferences and universities, where I cover topics such as cloud security, secure code review, and 
            general application security. I demonstrate my commitment to the field through 
            published HackTheBox challenges, supporting the next generation of cyber security professionals.

            <h3> Certifications </h3>
            I have earned 4 certifications which display my passion for learning and
            pedigree of cyber skills. These were chosen to support my general security knowledge, cloud development 
            abilities, and offensive testing skills.<br />
            <ul>
                <li>CompTIA Security+ (2023)</li>
                <li>AWS Developer Associate (2021-2024)</li>
                <li>AWS Security Specialty (2021-2024)</li>
                <li>Offensive Security Web Assessor (2023)</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            Today I keep my skills relevant and cutting-edge through the contributions to OWASP, learning from my peers as we develop
            the latest and most up-to-date cyber security controls.
