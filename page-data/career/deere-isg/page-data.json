In my role as the main security contact for all of John Deere's Operations Center teams, I was tasked with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Supporting their vulnerability management with our bug bounty partners</li>\n<li>Providing secure architecture guidance for their cloud-native equipment data processing pipeline</li>\n<li>Diving deep into individual products' code in search for vulnerabilities</li>\n<li>Communicating technical security concepts and a variety of levels of depth to an organization with over 50 teams.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"Accomplishments\" style=\"position:relative;\">Accomplishments<a href=\"#Accomplishments\" aria-label=\"Accomplishments permalink\" class=\"blogLink after\"><svg height=\"20\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"20\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" stroke=\"#000000\" fill=\"#000000\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h3>\n<p>I am proud to say that during my tenure our exploitable bug bounty vulnerability findings decreased by 50% on a year over year basis. Additionally, we lowered mean time to remediation for our high severity findings by 22%. These incredible achievements are not mine alone, rather my partnership with ISG's SRE group and the dedication of the entire ISG leadership team led to such an effective outcome. This speaks to my abilities to influence and push for a goal when I can't just say \"thou shalt\". I work to build meaningful relationships and engineer solutions which will lift up developers, rather than slow them down.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 2023 - August 2024","slug":"/career/deere-isg","title":"Staff Application Security Engineer"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"1357ed1d-9b07-5fc7-ad13-7a1e98085da8","frontmatter__slug":"/career/deere-isg","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"career"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
